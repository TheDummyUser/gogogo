**Happy New Year, everyone!**

By the time you're reading this, it's likely to be 2025 (crazy, right?). So, let's kick things off by wishing you all a fantastic new year! 🎉

**Now, I can already hear you thinking:** _"What happened to the BUNNY project you mentioned earlier?"_ Well, here's the brutally honest truth—I haven’t written a single line of code for it in the last two months. Yes, two months. No progress. Nada.

Why, you ask? Ah, where do I even begin? First of all, work has been absolutely demanding. The hours are wild—by the time I’m done, it’s already 11 PM (or as the sophisticated folks say, 23:00). At that point, my brain is mush, and the only thing I’m capable of improving is my sleep quality. Secondly, we’ve recently moved houses. Yep, new house, same chaotic me. I haven’t even set up my PC yet, and honestly, I’ve completely lost track of time. It’s been... well, a while.

During this "PC-less" phase, I decided to take the plunge and switch from Windows to the quirky world of [**NixOS**](https://nixos.org/). (Yes, I’m now one of _those_ people.) If I can stop procrastinating long enough, I’ll document my journey from Windows to NixOS for you all. Spoiler alert: It’s an adventure filled with moments of mystery, frustration, and more than a few “Why isn’t this working!?” moments. I’m also figuring out how to make Android Studio play nicely with NixOS—it’s definitely a different beast compared to other Linux distros. A blog post detailing my NixOS setup is on the horizon... eventually.

Speaking of blogs, let me vent about my current "blogging workflow" (if you can even call it that). At the moment, I write my blogs in Obsidian, save them in a local folder, and then manually move them to my project directory before pushing them to Git. Every. Single. Time. It’s a headache, and honestly, I’ve had enough.

So, here’s the plan: I’m going to build a CLI tool to automate the entire blog-uploading process. Think of it as my personal assistant who loves Git and never complains about repetitive tasks. Of course, I’ll be writing it in Go because (a) it’s fast, (b) it’s easy, and (c) it makes me feel cool.

In a few days, I’ll also be writing another blog post explaining NixOS and the setup I’m currently using. It’s so good and incredibly easy to set up—trust me, it’ll be worth reading!
